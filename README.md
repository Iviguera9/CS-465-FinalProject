# CS-465-FinalProject

For this project, a combination of Express, HTML, JavaScript, and Single-page Application (SPA) were used for the development of a simple web page. Although all these development tools were used 
to acomplish the same goal, each tool had their specific tasks that separated them for each other. Express was in charge of using the HTML files for the communication between user requests an database.
The Angular interface helped push the SPA's to the client and responsible for handling the JavaScript files used for the web page control. Due to the ease in communication between JSON and MongoDB, a
NoSQL MongoDB database was chosen over other database tools. For the same reason, JSON's functioning with the implemented API's proved to have a better communication between client and database.

An example of refractoring code to imrpove functionality, and benefitting its UI with reused code, could be found with some HTML files. This was due to the fact that multiple HTML files share a similarity 
between them to make them consistent. This also helped on the controllers code section by simplifyng function calls and function imports.

From my experience and understanding in full-stack development, the main functionality aspects of the methods used in this project are for: putting, getting, posting, and deleting functions that are used
across multiple files. Endpoints refer to the location among the system's API where the application components and methods meet so they can communicate with each other and work-off from their specific
functionality. Security is the most important of a full-stack application that uses a dedicated database due to the data protection it needs to keep maximum application functionality and expliot prevention.

The most important skills that I took from this course were documented refactoring and method communication between different program files. These skills are very important in this career due to the complexity
that some system have, that can come with problematic errors. Having learned these skills made me more attentive to possible exploits, errors, and problems that a system this size can have, and how to correct them.
Furthermore, refactoring and fixing mistakes in my code made me aware of possible skills that can only improve the efficiency and cleanliness of a code.
